# Daily Motivation Web App

This project is a simple web application that displays daily motivational quotes. The quotes can be translated into different languages, and the app also includes a soothing ocean wave sound that users can toggle on and off. The quotes transition smoothly with a fade effect when the user requests a new quote or changes the language.

## Features

- **Daily Motivational Quotes**: Displays a random motivational quote fetched from an API.
- **Language Translation**: Allows users to translate the quote into several languages, including English, Spanish, French, German, Chinese, and Arabic.
- **Smooth Transitions**: The quote smoothly fades out and in when switching between quotes or languages.
- **Background Music**: A soothing ocean wave sound can be toggled on and off by the user.
- **Animated Starry Background**: The background features a subtle, animated starry sky effect.
